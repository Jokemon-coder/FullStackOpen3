Full Stack Open Course part 3

This repository contains all of the tasks for FullStackOpen courses chapter 3. It introduced to many helpful tools when it comes to Node and backend development in general. It also gave me good insight into MongoDB, which I have not used before. Error handling was familiar to be beforehand, 
but the ways of error handling shown in this section of the course was new to me and interesting. Overall I would say this chapter was good and opened many different paths for me to explore further independently sometime in the foreseeable future.
